actually I think this book is bad:cause it won't teach you things that meaningful, I mean it just teach you how to do morning dirary, but if you don't want to think of yourself, 
then it's useless 

I read this book, take me only like 30 minutes, because lots of detail I am not really look at it, I already know what I need from this book.But it's quite useful, cuz I now use it 
everyday, every morning I will wake up and write what happen yesterday and some of my thought, then write down today's plan.

I thought this habit is quite useful, because everyday you would need to think about how is this day, give yourself a feedback, why don't do it before bed?  
There is a quite important reason is that at night you are so impacted by what happened today, you need to go sleep to calm yourself, then you can write it without much feelings.

And one detail I think it's quite useful, you write different year same day in the same page, then you would do the review for what you have done the day last year.
